SuperCDMS Noise Analysis Package
================================

This is the beginnings of an analysis package to study noise related
parameters of interest in detector R&D work. This package allows the user
to cacluate the Power spectral densities of signals from detectors, study 
correlations, and a fitting routine to de-couple the intrinsic noise
from cross channel correlated noise.

## Getting Started

Currently the package is not yet available on PyPI. To use the package in its 
current state, clone this folder from the repository by doing the following in the 
terminal
````
>>> git init Fink_ay250_homework
>>> cd Fink_ay250_homework
>>> git remote add -f origin https://github.com/cwfink/Fink_ay250_homework.git
>>> git config core.sparseCheckout true
>>>
>>> echo "noise_analysis" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
>>>
>>> git pull origin master
````


### Requirements

This package was written using Python 3.6.0 and Anaconda 4.3.1
Care was taken so that the code should be compatible with pythong 2.7, 
but no guarantee that it will work.

### Description of Files

## noise_example.ipynb
An example of how to use the noise class in a jupyter notebook

## supplental_note.pdf
This document provides the mathematical background behind the method to 
seperate the correlated and uncorrelated noise


## noise.py
this files contains the noise class with the following methods and attributes:

#### attributes
---
````traces````: a numpy ndarray of shape (number of traces, number of channels, number of data points in trace) to hold the time series data. 

````sampleRate````: the sample rate in Hz of the ADC used, can be int or float.

````channNames````: a list or array containing the names of the channels used must be the same length as traces.shape[1].

````time````: an 1d array with the time values corresponding to the traces. must be the same length as traces.shape[2]. Defaults to None.

````name````: a string name for the noise object to be used to title figures. Defaults to None.

````traceGain````: conversion factor to convert from ADC bins to Amperes. If traces have already been converted, this defaults to 1.0.

````freqs````: the frequencies corresponding to the PSD data. Calculated automatically
upon instantiation of a noise object.

````PSD````: The Power spectral densisty of the traces for each channel. array of 
shape (number of channels, len of freqs), where len PSD is determined automatically.

````real_PSD````: The 'real' part of the PSD, ie the real part of the FFT squared. Same 
shape as the PSD.

````imag_PSD````: The 'imaginary' part of the PSD, similar to real_PSD

````corrCoeff````:  the cross channel correlations as a function of frequency, ndarray with 
shape (number of channels, number of channels, length of freqs).

````unCorrNoise````: ndarray with the intrinsic noise for each channel, array of shape (number of channels, number of frequencies used in calculation).

````corrNoise````: ndarray with the correlated component of the noise for each channel, 
array of shape (number of channels, number of frequencies used in calculation).

````sigR````: the variance of the intrinsic part of the noise given by the de-correlation fit. array of shape (number of channels, number of frequencies used in calculation).

````sigC````: the variance of the correlated part of the noise given by the de-correlation fit. array of shape (number of frequencies used in calculation).

````reA````: the real part of the coupling factor of the correlated noise (see supplanent_note.pdf). array of shape (number of channels, number of frequencies used in calculation).

````imA````: the imaginary part of the coupling factor of the correlated noise (see supplanent_note.pdf). array of shape (number of channels, number of frequencies used in calculation).

````freqs_fit````: the frequencies used in the dc-correlation noise fit. User specified range of ````freqs_CSD````

````freqs_CSD````: the frequencies used to calculate the CSD. User provides number of frequencies desired. In not given, defaults to ````freqs````.

````CSD````: the cross channel spectral density. array of shape (number of channels, len of freqs used to calculate CSD).

````real_CSD````: real part of ````CSD````.

````imag_CSD````: imaginary part of ````CSD````.

````real_CSD_std````: the standart deviation of the real part of ````CSD````.

````imag_CSD_std````: the standart deviation of the imaginary part of ````CSD````.



All attributes have a 'set' method where the user can supply the value of any attribute after a noise object is created. all commands will be ````set_````attribute to be set. ie. ````set_traceGain(value)```` sets the ````traceGain```` to ````value````
